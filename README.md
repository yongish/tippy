# Pre-work - *Tippy*

**Tippy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Zhiyong Tan**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1**: "What are your reactions to the iOS app development platform so far? How would you describe outlets and actions to another developer? Bonus: any idea how they are being implemented under the hood? (It might give you some ideas if you right-click on the Storyboard and click Open As->Source Code")

**Answer:** Intuitive way of connecting outlets and actions, but seems like good naming conventions are required, or another developer may not be able to connect outlets to actions. We can describe an outlet as a way for an iOS interface element to pass a user input (such as tap or slide) to an action, which is a method that the programmer uses to make the app do something (access DB, make API call, change properties of another instance, etc).

Question 2: "Swift uses [Automatic Reference Counting](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH20-ID49) (ARC), which is not a garbage collector, to manage memory. Can you explain how you can get a strong reference cycle for closures? (There's a section explaining this concept in the link, how would you summarize as simply as possible?)"

**Answer:** Assign a closure to a property of a class instance. If the closure accesses a property or calls a method of that instance, there will be a strong reference cycle. This is avoided by having an expression within the closure in square brackets, containing a list of class instance or variables initialized with a value, and a "weak" or "unowned" keyword in front of each list element.
